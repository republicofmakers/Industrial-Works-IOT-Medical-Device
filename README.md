# Industrial-Works-IOT-Medical-Device

Here is IOT-Medical-Device

IOT device with multiple sensors , sensors were quite expensive so I had to design hardware cheap as possible.

I used Bluetooth (Standard 4.2) , with deep sleep. Eventhough esp32 power consumption is quite high, device will be used only once a month.

ESP32 deep sleep power consuption is quite impressive. And price / processing power wise was suitable for this project.

Design Flex PCB and develeoped firmware for sensor modules.

Here is PCB Design:

All system completely develeloped by me without any external support. (Only hardware)

NOTE: I didnt not develop smart phone app.
